Arsenic occurs in many minerals, usually in conjunction with sulfur and metals, and also as a pure elemental crystal.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main use of metallic arsenic is for strengthening alloys of copper and especially lead (for example, in car batteries). Arsenic is a common n-type dopant in semiconductor electronic devices, and the optoelectronic compound gallium arsenide is the most common semiconductor in use after doped silicon. Arsenic and its compounds, especially the trioxide, are used in the production of pesticides, treated wood products, herbicides, and insecticides. These applications are declining, however.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arsenic is notoriously poisonous to multicellular life and arsenic contamination of groundwater is a problem that affects millions of people across the world.<\/p>"}}
