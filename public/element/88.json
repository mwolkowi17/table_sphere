{"element":{"ElementSymbol":"Ra","ElementName":"Radium","AtomicNumber":88,"AtomicWeight":226,"PhysicalProperties":[{"Property":["Melting point","973"],"PropertyType":["Kelvin","K"]},{"Property":["Boiling point","2010"],"PropertyType":["Kelvin","K"]}],"MoreInfoLink":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Radium","BriefDescription":"<p>Radium is an almost pure-white alkaline earth metal, but it readily oxidizes on exposure to air, becoming black in color. All isotopes of radium are highly radioactive, with the most stable isotope being radium-226, which has a half-life of 1601 years and decays into radon gas. Because of such instability, radium is luminescent, glowing a faint blue.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In nature, radium is found in uranium ores in trace amounts as small as a seventh of a gram per ton of uraninite. Radium is not necessary for living organisms, and adverse health effects are likely when it is incorporated into biochemical processes because of its radioactivity and chemical reactivity.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Radium has few practical applications, and more recently discovered radioisotopes, such as 60Co and 137Cs, are replacing radium in even these limited uses because several of these isotopes are more powerful emitters, safer to handle, and available in more concentrated form."}}
