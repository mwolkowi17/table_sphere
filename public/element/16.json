Under normal conditions, sulfur atoms form cyclic octatomic molecules with chemical formula S8.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sulfur occurs naturally as the pure element (native sulfur) and as sulfide and sulfate minerals. Elemental sulfur crystals are commonly sought after by mineral collectors for their distinct, brightly colored polyhedron shapes.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sulfur is an essential element for all life, and is widely used in biochemical processes. In metabolic reactions, sulfur compounds serve as both fuels (electron donors) and respiratory (oxygen-alternative) materials.<\/p>"}}
