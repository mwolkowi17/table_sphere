{"element":{"ElementSymbol":"B","ElementName":"Boron","AtomicNumber":5,"AtomicWeight":10.81,"PhysicalProperties":[{"Property":["Melting point","2349"],"PropertyType":["Kelvin","K"]},{"Property":["Boiling point","4200"],"PropertyType":["Kelvin","K"]}],"MoreInfoLink":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Boron","BriefDescription":"<p>Boron is a low-abundance element which (in its chemically uncombined form) is found in small amounts in meteoroids, but is not found naturally on Earth. Although very pure boron can produced industrially with some difficulty.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In biology, borates have low toxicity in mammals, but are more toxic to arthropods and are used as insecticides. Furthermore Boron is essential to life, small amounts of boron compounds play a strengthening role in the cell walls of all plants, making boron necessary in soils.<\/p>"}}
