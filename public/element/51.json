{"element":{"ElementSymbol":"Sb","ElementName":"Antimony","AtomicNumber":51,"AtomicWeight":121.76,"PhysicalProperties":[{"Property":["Melting point","903.78"],"PropertyType":["Kelvin","K"]},{"Property":["Boiling point","1860"],"PropertyType":["Kelvin","K"]}],"MoreInfoLink":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Antimony","BriefDescription":"<p>Antimony is a lustrous gray metalloid, it is found in nature mainly as the sulfide mineral stibnite (Sb2S3). Antimony compounds have been known since ancient times and were used for cosmetics; metallic antimony was also known, but it was erroneously identified as lead. It was established to be an element around the 17th century.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>For some time, China has been the largest producer of antimony and its compounds, with most production coming from the Xikuangshan Mine in Hunan. The industrial methods to produce antimony are roasting and subsequent carbothermal reduction or direct reduction of stibnite with iron.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The largest applications for metallic antimony are as alloying material for lead and tin and for lead antimony plates in lead-acid batteries. Alloying lead and tin with antimony improves the properties of the alloys which are used in solders, bullets and plain bearings. An emerging application is the use of antimony in microelectronics.<\/p>"}}
