{"element":{"ElementSymbol":"Lv","ElementName":"Livermorium","AtomicNumber":116,"AtomicWeight":293,"PhysicalProperties":[],"MoreInfoLink":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Livermorium","BriefDescription":"<p>Livermorium is the synthetic superheavy element with the symbol Lv and atomic number 116. The name was adopted by IUPAC on May 30, 2012.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is placed as the heaviest member of group 16 (VIA) although a sufficiently stable isotope is not known at this time to allow chemical experiments to confirm its position as a heavier homologue to polonium.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was first detected in 2000. Since then, about 35 atoms of livermorium have been produced, either directly or as a decay product of ununoctium, belonging to the four neighbouring isotopes with masses 290\u00e2\u0080\u0093293. The most stable isotope known is livermorium-293 with a half-life of ~60 ms.<\/p>"}}
