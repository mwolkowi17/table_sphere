{"element":{"ElementSymbol":"Br","ElementName":"Bromine","AtomicNumber":35,"AtomicWeight":79.904,"PhysicalProperties":[{"Property":["Melting point","265.8"],"PropertyType":["Kelvin","K"]},{"Property":["Boiling point","332"],"PropertyType":["Kelvin","K"]}],"MoreInfoLink":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bromine","BriefDescription":"<p>Bromine is a diatomic nonmetal. Elemental bromine is a fuming red-brown liquid at room temperature, corrosive and toxic, with properties between those of chlorine and iodine.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bromine is rarer than about three-quarters of elements in the Earth's crust; however, the high solubility of bromide ion has caused its accumulation in the oceans, and commercially the element is easily extracted from brine pools, mostly in the United States, Israel and China. About 556,000 tonnes were produced in 2007, an amount similar to the far more abundant element magnesium.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bromine has no essential function in mammals, though it is preferentially used over chlorine by one antiparasitic enzyme in the human immune system.<\/p>"}}
