Dysprosium is never found in nature as a free element, though it is found in various minerals, such as xenotime.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dysprosium was first identified in 1886 by Paul \u00c3\u0089mile Lecoq de Boisbaudran, but was not isolated in pure form until the development of ion exchange techniques in the 1950s. Dysprosium is used for its high thermal neutron absorption cross-section in making control rods in nuclear reactors, for its high magnetic susceptibility in data storage applications, and as a component of Terfenol-D. Soluble dysprosium salts are mildly toxic, while the insoluble salts are considered non-toxic.<\/p>"}}
