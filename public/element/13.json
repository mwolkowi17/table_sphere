{"element":{"ElementSymbol":"Al","ElementName":"Aluminium","AtomicNumber":13,"AtomicWeight":26.9815,"PhysicalProperties":[{"Property":["Melting point","933.47"],"PropertyType":["Kelvin","K"]},{"Property":["Boiling point","2792"],"PropertyType":["Kelvin","K"]}],"MoreInfoLink":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Aluminium","BriefDescription":"<p>Aluminium is a silvery white, soft, ductile metal. Aluminium is the third most abundant element (after oxygen and silicon), and the most abundant metal, in the Earth's crust. It makes up about 8% by weight of the Earth's solid surface.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aluminium is remarkable for the metal's low density and for its ability to resist corrosion due to the phenomenon of passivation. Structural components made from aluminium and its alloys are vital to the aerospace industry and are important in other areas of transportation and structural materials. <\/p>"}}
