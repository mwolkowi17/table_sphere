Manganese is a metal with important industrial metal alloy uses, particularly in stainless steels.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Manganese phosphating is used as a treatment for rust and corrosion prevention on steel. Depending on their oxidation state, manganese ions have various colors and are used industrially as pigments. The permanganates of alkali and alkaline earth metals are powerful oxidizers. Manganese dioxide is used as the cathode (electron acceptor) material in zinc-carbon and alkaline batteries.<\/p>"}}
