{"element":{"ElementSymbol":"Kr","ElementName":"Krypton","AtomicNumber":36,"AtomicWeight":83.798,"PhysicalProperties":[{"Property":["Melting point","115.78"],"PropertyType":["Kelvin","K"]},{"Property":["Boiling point","119.93"],"PropertyType":["Kelvin","K"]}],"MoreInfoLink":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Krypton","BriefDescription":"<p>Krypton is a noble gas, and a member of group 18 (noble gases) elements. A colorless, odorless, tasteless noble gas, krypton occurs in trace amounts in the atmosphere, is isolated by fractionally distilling liquified air, and is often used with other rare gases in fluorescent lamps. Krypton is inert for most practical purposes.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Krypton, like the other noble gases, can be used in lighting and photography. Krypton light has a large number of spectral lines, and krypton's high light output in plasmas allows it to play an important role in many high-powered gas lasers, which pick out one of the many spectral lines to amplify.<\/p>"}}
