It rarely occurs in its elemental state in nature, or as pure ore compounds.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Selenium is found impurely in metal sulfide ores, where it partially replaces the sulfur. Commercially, selenium is produced as a byproduct in the refining of these ores, most often during copper production. Minerals that are pure selenide or selenate compounds are known, but are rare. The chief commercial uses for selenium today are in glassmaking and in pigments. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Selenium salts are toxic in large amounts, but trace amounts are necessary for cellular function in many organisms, including all animals.<\/p>"}}
