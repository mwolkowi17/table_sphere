Because of its high chemical reactivity barium is never found in nature as a free element.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Barium has only a few industrial applications. The metal has been historically used to scavenge air in vacuum tubes. It is a component of YBCO (high-temperature superconductors) and electroceramics, and is added to steel and cast iron to reduce the size of carbon grains within the microstructure of the metal. Barium compounds are added to fireworks to impart a green color (Barium burns green).<\/p>"}}
