{"element":{"ElementSymbol":"Tc","ElementName":"Technetium","AtomicNumber":43,"AtomicWeight":98,"PhysicalProperties":[{"Property":["Melting point","2430"],"PropertyType":["Kelvin","K"]},{"Property":["Boiling point","4538"],"PropertyType":["Kelvin","K"]}],"MoreInfoLink":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Technetium","BriefDescription":"<p>Technetium is the lowest atomic number element without any stable isotopes; every form of it is radioactive. Nearly all technetium is produced synthetically, and only minute amounts are found in nature. Naturally occurring technetium occurs as a spontaneous fission product in uranium ore or by neutron capture in molybdenum ores. The chemical properties of this silvery gray, crystalline transition metal are intermediate between rhenium and manganese.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its short-lived gamma ray-emitting nuclear isomer\u00e2\u0080\u0094technetium-99m\u00e2\u0080\u0094is used in nuclear medicine for a wide variety of diagnostic tests. Technetium-99 is used as a gamma ray-free source of beta particles. Long-lived technetium isotopes produced commercially are by-products of fission of uranium-235 in nuclear reactors and are extracted from nuclear fuel rods. Because no isotope of technetium has a half-life longer than 4.2 million years (technetium-98), its detection in 1952 in red giants, which are billions of years old, helped bolster the theory that stars can produce heavier elements.<\/p>"}}
