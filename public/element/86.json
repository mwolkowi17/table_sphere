{"element":{"ElementSymbol":"Rn","ElementName":"Radon","AtomicNumber":86,"AtomicWeight":222,"PhysicalProperties":[{"Property":["Melting point","202"],"PropertyType":["Kelvin","K"]},{"Property":["Boiling point","211.5"],"PropertyType":["Kelvin","K"]}],"MoreInfoLink":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Radon","BriefDescription":"<p>Radon is a radioactive, colorless, odorless, tasteless noble gas, occurring naturally as an indirect decay product of uranium or thorium. Its most stable isotope, 222Rn, has a half-life of 3.8 days. Radon is one of the densest substances that remains a gas under normal conditions. It is also the only gas under normal conditions that only has radioactive isotopes, and is considered a health hazard due to its radioactivity. Intense radioactivity has also hindered chemical studies of radon and only a few compounds are known.<\/p>"}}
