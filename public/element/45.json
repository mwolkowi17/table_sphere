{"element":{"ElementSymbol":"Rh","ElementName":"Rhodium","AtomicNumber":45,"AtomicWeight":102.906,"PhysicalProperties":[{"Property":["Melting point","2237"],"PropertyType":["Kelvin","K"]},{"Property":["Boiling point","3968"],"PropertyType":["Kelvin","K"]}],"MoreInfoLink":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rhodium","BriefDescription":"<p>Rhodium is a chemical element that is a rare, silvery-white, hard, and chemically inert transition metal and a member of the platinum group. It is composed of only one naturally-occurring isotope, 103Rh. Naturally occurring rhodium is usually found as the free metal, alloyed with similar metals, and rarely as a chemical compound in minerals such as bowieite and rhodplumsite. It is one of the rarest and most valuable precious metals.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The element's major use (approximately 80% of world rhodium production) is as one of the catalysts in the three-way catalytic converters in automobiles. Because rhodium metal is inert against corrosion and most aggressive chemicals, and because of its rarity, rhodium is usually alloyed with platinum or palladium and applied in high-temperature and corrosion-resistive coatings. White gold is often plated with a thin rhodium layer to improve its appearance while sterling silver is often rhodium plated for tarnish resistance.<\/p>"}}
