A radioactive actinide metal, neptunium is the first transuranic element. Its position in the periodic table just after uranium, named after the planet Uranus, led to its being named after Neptune, the next planet beyond Uranus.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most stable isotope of neptunium, neptunium-237, is a by-product of nuclear reactors and plutonium production, and it can be used as a component in neutron detection equipment. The isotopes neptunium-237 and neptunium-239 are also found in trace amounts in uranium ores due to neutron capture reactions and beta decay.<\/p>"}}
