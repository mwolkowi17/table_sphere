Tin is the 49th most abundant element and has, with 10 stable isotopes, the largest number of stable isotopes in the periodic table. Tin is obtained chiefly from the mineral cassiterite, where it occurs as tin dioxide, SnO2<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>This silvery, malleable other metal is not easily oxidized in air and is used to coat other metals to prevent corrosion. Tin is used in many alloys, most notably tin\/lead soft solders, typically containing 60% or more of tin. Another large application for tin is corrosion-resistant tin plating of steel. Because of its low toxicity, tin-plated metal is also used for food packaging, giving the name to tin cans, which are made mostly of steel.<\/p>"}}
