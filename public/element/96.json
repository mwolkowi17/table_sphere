This element of the actinide series was named after Marie and Pierre Curie \u00e2\u0080\u0093 both were known for their research on radioactivity.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Curium is a hard, dense, silvery metal with a relatively high melting point and boiling point for an actinide. Whereas it is paramagnetic at ambient conditions, it becomes antiferromagnetic upon cooling, and other magnetic transitions are also observed for many curium compounds. In compounds, curium usually exhibits valence +3 and sometimes +4, and the +3 valence is predominant in solutions.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>All known isotopes of curium are radioactive and have a small critical mass for a sustained nuclear chain reaction. They predominantly emit \u00ce\u00b1-particles, and the heat released in this process can potentially produce electricity in radioisotope thermoelectric generators. This application is hindered by the scarcity, high cost and radioactivity of curium isotopes. Curium is used in production of heavier actinides and of the 238Pu radionuclide for power sources in artificial pacemakers. "}}
