{"element":{"ElementSymbol":"Zn","ElementName":"Zinc","AtomicNumber":30,"AtomicWeight":65.38,"PhysicalProperties":[{"Property":["Melting point","692.68"],"PropertyType":["Kelvin","K"]},{"Property":["Boiling point","1180"],"PropertyType":["Kelvin","K"]}],"MoreInfoLink":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Zinc","BriefDescription":"<p>Zinc is a metallic chemical element, in some respects, chemically similar to magnesium, because its ion is of similar size and its only common oxidation state is +2. Zinc is the 24th most abundant element in the Earth's crust and has five stable isotopes.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zinc is an essential mineral of \"exceptional biologic and public health importance\". Zinc deficiency affects about two billion people in the developing world and is associated with many diseases. In children it causes growth retardation, delayed sexual maturation, infection susceptibility, and diarrhea, contributing to the death of about 800,000 children worldwide per year. Enzymes with a zinc atom in the reactive center are widespread in biochemistry, such as alcohol dehydrogenase in humans. Consumption of excess zinc can cause ataxia, lethargy and copper deficiency.<\/p>"}}
