{"element":{"ElementSymbol":"V","ElementName":"Vanadium","AtomicNumber":23,"AtomicWeight":50.9415,"PhysicalProperties":[{"Property":["Melting point","2183"],"PropertyType":["Kelvin","K"]},{"Property":["Boiling point","3680"],"PropertyType":["Kelvin","K"]}],"MoreInfoLink":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Vanadium","BriefDescription":"<p>Vanadium is a hard, silvery gray, ductile and malleable transition metal. The element is found only in chemically combined form in nature, but once isolated artificially, the formation of an oxide layer stabilizes the free metal somewhat against further oxidation.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vanadium occurs naturally in about 65 different minerals and in fossil fuel deposits. It is produced in China and Russia from steel smelter slag; other countries produce it either from the flue dust of heavy oil, or as a byproduct of uranium mining. It is mainly used to produce specialty steel alloys such as high speed tool steels. The most important industrial vanadium compound, vanadium pentoxide, is used as a catalyst for the production of sulfuric acid.<\/p>"}}
