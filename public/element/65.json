{"element":{"ElementSymbol":"Tb","ElementName":"Terbium","AtomicNumber":65,"AtomicWeight":158.925,"PhysicalProperties":[{"Property":["Melting point","1629"],"PropertyType":["Kelvin","K"]},{"Property":["Boiling point","3503"],"PropertyType":["Kelvin","K"]}],"MoreInfoLink":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Terbium","BriefDescription":"<p>Terbium is a silvery-white rare earth metal that is malleable, ductile and very hard. Terbium is never found in nature as a free element, but it is contained in many minerals, including cerite, gadolinite, monazite, xenotime and euxenite.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Terbium is used to dope calcium fluoride, calcium tungstate and strontium molybdate, materials that are used in solid-state devices, and as a crystal stabilizer of fuel cells which operate at elevated temperatures. As a component of Terfenol-D (an alloy that expands and contracts when exposed to magnetic fields more than any other alloy), terbium is of use in actuators, in naval sonar systems and in sensors.<\/p>"}}
