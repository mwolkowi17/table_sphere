It is also abundant on Earth, forming around 80% of Earth's atmosphere.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>At room temperature, it is a gas of diatomic molecules and is both colorless and odorless.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The extremely strong bond in elemental nitrogen dominates nitrogen chemistry, causing difficulty for both organisms and industry in converting the N\r\n2 into useful compounds, but at the same time causing release of large amounts of often useful energy when the compounds burn, explode, or decay back into nitrogen gas.<\/p>"}}
