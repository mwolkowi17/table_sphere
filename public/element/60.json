It is present in significant quantities in the ore minerals monazite and bastn\u00c3\u00a4site. Neodymium is not found naturally in metallic form or unmixed with other lanthanides, and it is usually refined for general use. Although neodymium is classed as a \"rare earth\", it is a fairly common element, no rarer than cobalt, nickel, and copper, and is widely distributed in the Earth's crust. Most of the world's neodymium is mined in China.<\/p>"}}
