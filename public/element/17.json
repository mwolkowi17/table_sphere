{"element":{"ElementSymbol":"Cl","ElementName":"Chlorine","AtomicNumber":17,"AtomicWeight":35.45,"PhysicalProperties":[{"Property":["Melting point","171.6"],"PropertyType":["Kelvin","K"]},{"Property":["Boiling point","239.11"],"PropertyType":["Kelvin","K"]}],"MoreInfoLink":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Chlorine","BriefDescription":"<p>Chlorine is in the halogen group (17) and is the second lightest halogen after fluorine. The element is a yellow-green gas under standard conditions, where it forms diatomic molecules. Free chlorine is rare on Earth, and is usually a result of direct or indirect oxidation by oxygen.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the form of chloride ions, chlorine is necessary to all known species of life. Other types of chlorine compounds are rare in living organisms, and artificially produced chlorinated organics range from inert to toxic (at high concentrations Chlorine is extremely dangerous and poisonous for all living organisms).<\/p>"}}
