{"element":{"ElementSymbol":"La","ElementName":"Lanthanum","AtomicNumber":57,"AtomicWeight":138.905,"PhysicalProperties":[{"Property":["Melting point","1193"],"PropertyType":["Kelvin","K"]},{"Property":["Boiling point","3737"],"PropertyType":["Kelvin","K"]}],"MoreInfoLink":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lanthanum","BriefDescription":"<p>Lanthanum is a silvery white metallic element and is the first element of the lanthanide series (or, on occasion, considered the first element of the 6th-period transition metals).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lanthanum is found in some rare-earth minerals, usually in combination with cerium and other rare earth elements. Lanthanum is a malleable, ductile, and soft metal that oxidizes rapidly when exposed to air. It is produced from the minerals monazite and bastnasite using a complex multistage extraction process. Lanthanum compounds have numerous applications as catalysts, additives in glass, carbon lighting for studio lighting and projection, ignition elements in lighters and torches, electron cathodes, scintillators, tig welding electrodes, and others.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>It should be noted that, although lanthanum belongs to the element group called rare earth metals, it is not rare at all. Lanthanum is available in relatively large quantities (32 ppm in Earth's crust). Lanthanum is taken into consideration as a rare earth metal because the process to mine is difficult, time consuming and expensive.<\/p>"}}
