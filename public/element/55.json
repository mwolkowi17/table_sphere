{"element":{"ElementSymbol":"Cs","ElementName":"Caesium","AtomicNumber":55,"AtomicWeight":132.905,"PhysicalProperties":[{"Property":["Melting point","301.7"],"PropertyType":["Kelvin","K"]},{"Property":["Boiling point","944"],"PropertyType":["Kelvin","K"]}],"MoreInfoLink":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Caesium","BriefDescription":"<p>Caesium is a soft, silvery-gold alkali metal with a melting point of 28 \u00c2\u00b0C (82 \u00c2\u00b0F), which makes it one of only five elemental metals that are liquid at or near room temperature. Caesium is an alkali metal and has physical and chemical properties similar to those of rubidium and potassium. The metal is extremely reactive and pyrophoric, reacting with water even at \u00e2\u0088\u0092116 \u00c2\u00b0C.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the 1990s, the largest application of the element has been as caesium formate for drilling fluids. It has a range of applications in the production of electricity, in electronics, and in chemistry.<\/p>"}}
