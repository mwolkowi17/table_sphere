{"element":{"ElementSymbol":"Sg","ElementName":"Seaborgium","AtomicNumber":106,"AtomicWeight":269,"PhysicalProperties":[],"MoreInfoLink":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Seaborgium","BriefDescription":"<p>Seaborgium is a synthetic element with the symbol Sg and atomic number 106, whose most stable isotope 271Sg has a half-life of 1.9 minutes. A more recently discovered isotope 269Sg has a potentially slightly longer half-life (ca. 2.1 min) based on the observation of a single decay. Chemistry experiments with seaborgium have firmly placed it in group 6 as a heavier homologue to tungsten.<\/p>"}}
