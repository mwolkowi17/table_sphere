If it is held in the human hand long enough, gallium will melt, since it melts at the temperature of about 29.76 \u00c2\u00b0C (85.57 \u00c2\u00b0F) (slightly above room temperature).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, nearly all gallium is used in electronics. Gallium arsenide, the primary chemical compound of gallium in electronics, is used in microwave circuits, high-speed switching circuits, and infrared circuits. Gallium nitride and indium gallium nitride, minority semiconductor uses, produce blue and violet light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and diode lasers.<\/p>"}}
