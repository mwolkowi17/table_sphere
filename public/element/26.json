It by mass is the most common element on Earth, forming much of Earth's outer and inner core. It is the fourth most common element in the Earth's crust. Iron's very common presence in rocky planets like Earth is due to its abundant production as a result of fusion in high-mass stars, wherein the production of nickel-56 (which decays to the most common isotope of iron) is the last nuclear fusion reaction that is exothermic. Therefore, radioactive nickel is the last element to be produced, before collapse of a supernova causes the explosion that abundantly scatters this precursor radionuclide into space.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iron has an important role in industry, alloyed with other elements it can be used to produce Steel (amongst other metals) which are by far the most common metals in industrial use, due to their great range of desirable properties and the abundance of iron.<\/p>"}}
