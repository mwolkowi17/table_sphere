The element can be found as grains of native (free) metal, although this very rare and not of commercial importance.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indium's current primary application is to form transparent electrodes from indium tin oxide (ITO) in liquid crystal displays and touchscreens, and this use largely determines its global mining production. It is widely used in thin-films to form lubricated layers. It is also used for making particularly low melting point alloys, and is a component in some lead-free solders.<\/p>"}}
