{"element":{"ElementSymbol":"C","ElementName":"Carbon","AtomicNumber":6,"AtomicWeight":12.011,"PhysicalProperties":[{"Property":["Sublimation point","3915"],"PropertyType":["Kelvin","K"]}],"MoreInfoLink":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Carbon","BriefDescription":"<p>There are several allotropes of carbon of which the best known are graphite, diamond, and amorphous carbon. The physical properties of carbon vary widely with the allotropic form. For example, diamond is highly transparent, while graphite is opaque and black. Diamond is the hardest naturally-occurring material known, while graphite is soft enough to form a streak on paper. Diamond has a very low electrical conductivity, while graphite is a very good conductor. Under normal conditions, diamond, carbon nanotube and graphene have the highest thermal conductivities of all known materials.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carbon is the 15th most abundant element in the Earth's crust. It is present in all known life forms, and in the human body carbon is the second most abundant element by mass (about 18.5%) after oxygen.<\/p>"}}
