{"element":{"ElementSymbol":"Pr","ElementName":"Praseodymium","AtomicNumber":59,"AtomicWeight":140.908,"PhysicalProperties":[{"Property":["Melting point","1208"],"PropertyType":["Kelvin","K"]},{"Property":["Boiling point","3793"],"PropertyType":["Kelvin","K"]}],"MoreInfoLink":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Praseodymium","BriefDescription":"<p>Praseodymium is a soft, silvery, malleable and ductile metal in the lanthanide group. Valued for its magnetic, electrical, chemical and optical properties, it is too reactive to be found in native form, and when artificially prepared, it slowly develops a green oxide coating.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like most rare earth elements, praseodymium most readily forms trivalent Pr(III) ions. These are yellow-green in water solution, and various shades of yellow-green when incorporated into glasses. Many of praseodymium's industrial uses involve its use to filter yellow light from light sources.<\/p>"}}
