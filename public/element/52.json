Applications in solar panels and as a semiconductor material also consume a considerable fraction of tellurium production.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tellurium has no biological function, although fungi can incorporate it in place of sulfur and selenium into amino acids such as tellurocysteine and telluromethionine.<\/p>"}}
