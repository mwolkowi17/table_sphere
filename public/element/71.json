{"element":{"ElementSymbol":"Lu","ElementName":"Lutetium","AtomicNumber":71,"AtomicWeight":174.967,"PhysicalProperties":[{"Property":["Melting point","1925"],"PropertyType":["Kelvin","K"]},{"Property":["Boiling point","3675"],"PropertyType":["Kelvin","K"]}],"MoreInfoLink":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lutetium","BriefDescription":"<p>Lutetium is a silvery white metal, which resists corrosion in dry, but not in moist air. It is the last element in the lanthanide series (or, on occasion, considered the first element of the 6th-period transition metals), and traditionally counted among the rare earths.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lutetium is not a particularly abundant element, though significantly more common than silver in the earth's crust; it has few specific uses. Lutetium-176 is a relatively abundant (2.5%) radioactive isotope with a half-life of about 38 billion years, and so used to determine the age of meteorites. Lutetium usually occurs in association with the element yttrium and is sometimes used in metal alloys and as a catalyst in various chemical reactions. 177Lu-DOTA-TATE is used for radionuclide therapy (see Nuclear medicine) on neuroendocrine tumours.<\/p>"}}
