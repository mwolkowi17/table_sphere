It is named after the city of Berkeley, California, the location of the University of California Radiation Laboratory where it was discovered in December 1949.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just over one gram of berkelium has been produced in the United States since 1967. There is no practical application of berkelium outside of scientific research which is mostly directed at the synthesis of heavier transuranic elements and transactinides. A 22 milligram batch of berkelium-249 was prepared during a 250-day irradiation period and then purified for a further 90 days at Oak Ridge in 2009. This sample was used to synthesize the element ununseptium for the first time in 2009 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, Russia, after it was bombarded with calcium-48 ions for 150 days. This was a culmination of the Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0093US collaboration on the synthesis of elements 113 to 118.<\/p>"}}
