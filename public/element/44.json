Like the other metals of the platinum group, ruthenium is inert to most other chemicals.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ruthenium usually occurs as a minor component of platinum ores; annual production is about 20 tonnes. Most ruthenium produced is used for wear-resistant electrical contacts and the production of thick-film resistors. A minor application of ruthenium is its use in some platinum alloys.<\/p>"}}
