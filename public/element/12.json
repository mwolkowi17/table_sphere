{"element":{"ElementSymbol":"MG","ElementName":"Magnesium","AtomicNumber":12,"AtomicWeight":24.305,"PhysicalProperties":[{"Property":["Melting point","923"],"PropertyType":["Kelvin","K"]},{"Property":["Boiling point","1363"],"PropertyType":["Kelvin","K"]}],"MoreInfoLink":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Magnesium","BriefDescription":"<p>Magnesium is an alkaline earth metal, it is the eighth-most-abundant element in the Earth's crust and ninth most abundant in the known universe. The relative abundance of magnesium is related to the fact that it easily builds up in supernova stars from a sequential addition of three helium nuclei to carbon (which in turn is made from three helium nuclei)<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The free element (metal) is not found naturally on Earth, as it is highly reactive (though once produced, it is coated in a thin layer of oxide (see passivation), which partly masks this reactivity). The free metal burns with a characteristic brilliant-white light, making it a useful ingredient in flares.<\/p>"}}
