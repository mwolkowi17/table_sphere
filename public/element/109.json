{"element":{"ElementSymbol":"Mt","ElementName":"Meitnerium","AtomicNumber":109,"AtomicWeight":278,"PhysicalProperties":[],"MoreInfoLink":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Meitnerium","BriefDescription":"<p>Meitnerium is a chemical element with symbol Mt and atomic number 109. It is an extremely radioactive synthetic element (an element not found in nature that can be created in a laboratory). The most stable known isotope, meitnerium-278, has a half-life of 7.6 seconds. The GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research near Darmstadt, Germany, first created this element in 1982.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the periodic table, meitnerium is a d-block transactinide element. It is a member of the 7th period and is placed in the group 9 elements, although no chemical experiments have been carried out to confirm that it behaves as the heavier homologue to iridium in group 9. Meitnerium is calculated to have similar properties to its lighter homologues, cobalt, rhodium, and iridium.<\/p>"}}
