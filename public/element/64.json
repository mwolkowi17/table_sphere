{"element":{"ElementSymbol":"Gd","ElementName":"Gadolinium","AtomicNumber":64,"AtomicWeight":157.25,"PhysicalProperties":[{"Property":["Melting point","1585"],"PropertyType":["Kelvin","K"]},{"Property":["Boiling point","3546"],"PropertyType":["Kelvin","K"]}],"MoreInfoLink":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gadolinium","BriefDescription":"<p>Gadolinium is a silvery-white, malleable and ductile rare-earth metal. It is found in nature only in combined (salt) form.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gadolinium metal possesses unusual metallurgic properties, to the extent that as little as 1% gadolinium can significantly improve the workability and resistance to high temperature oxidation of iron, chromium, and related alloys. Gadolinium as a metal or salt has exceptionally high absorption of neutrons and therefore is used for shielding in neutron radiography and in nuclear reactors. Like most rare earths, gadolinium forms trivalent ions which have fluorescent properties. Gadolinium(III) salts have therefore been used as green phosphors in various applications.<\/p>"}}
