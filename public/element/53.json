Iodine and its compounds are primarily used in nutrition, and industrially in the production of acetic acid and certain polymers. Iodine's relatively high atomic number, low toxicity, and ease of attachment to organic compounds have made it a part of many X-ray contrast materials in modern medicine. Iodine has only one stable isotope. A number of iodine radioisotopes are also used in medical applications.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iodine is found on Earth mainly as the highly water-soluble iodide ion I\u00e2\u0088\u0092 which concentrates it in oceans and brine pools.<\/p>"}}
