{"element":{"ElementSymbol":"Ne","ElementName":"Neon","AtomicNumber":10,"AtomicWeight":20.1797,"PhysicalProperties":[{"Property":["Melting point","24.56"],"PropertyType":["Kelvin","K"]},{"Property":["Boiling point","27.104"],"PropertyType":["Kelvin","K"]}],"MoreInfoLink":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Neon","BriefDescription":"<p>Neon is a colorless, odorless, inert monatomic gas under standard conditions, with about two-thirds the density of air.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neon gives a distinct reddish-orange glow when used in either low-voltage neon glow lamps or in high-voltage discharge tubes or neon advertising signs. The red emission line from neon is also responsible for the well known red light of helium-neon lasers. Neon is used in a few plasma tube and refrigerant applications but has few other commercial uses. It is commercially extracted by the fractional distillation of liquid air. It is considerably more expensive than helium, since air is its only source.<\/p>"}}
