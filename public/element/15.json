Elemental phosphorus exists in two major forms-white phosphorus and red phosphorus-but due to its high reactivity, phosphorus is never found as a free element on Earth.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The vast majority of phosphorus compounds are consumed as fertilisers. Other applications include the role of organophosphorus compounds in detergents, pesticides and nerve agents, and matches.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phosphorus is essential for life. As phosphate, it is a component of DNA, RNA, ATP, and also the phospholipids that form all cell membranes. The chief commercial use of phosphorus compounds for production of fertilisers is due to the need to replace the phosphorus that plants remove from the soil.<\/p>"}}
