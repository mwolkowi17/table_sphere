{"element":{"ElementSymbol":"Lr","ElementName":"Lawrencium","AtomicNumber":103,"AtomicWeight":262,"PhysicalProperties":[{"Property":["Melting point","1900"],"PropertyType":["Kelvin","K"]}],"MoreInfoLink":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lawrencium","BriefDescription":"<p>Lawrencium is a radioactive synthetic chemical element with the symbol Lr (formerly Lw) and atomic number 103. In the periodic table of the elements, it is a period 7 d-block element and the last element of the actinide series. Chemistry experiments have confirmed that lawrencium behaves as the heavier homologue to lutetium and is chemically similar to other actinides.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>All isotopes of lawrencium are radioactive; its most stable known isotope is lawrencium-262, with a half-life of approximately 3.6 hours. All its isotopes except for lawrencium-260, -261 and -262 decay with a half-life of less than a minute.<\/p>"}}
